SwiftHN
=======

#### A Hacker News reader in Swift using the best features of both the language and iOS 8 latest API (well, that's the end goal)


![screen-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimillian/SwiftHN/master/git_images/images.png)

SwiftHN is now available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=919243741&mt=8)! I've renamed it to HN Reader for obvious reasons. 

##### ETA
=======
# Installation
Clone this repository.
```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dimillian/SwiftHN
```

In case you cloned the repository without the `recursive` option, you will have
to manually install the HackerSwifter submodule.
```shell
$ cd SwiftHN
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Open using Xcode.
```shell
$ open SwiftHN.xcodeproj
```

# Features

The app is in progress, but is already functional, you can read the newsfeed, send articles to the Safari Reading List, view the article in a webview, and load comments.
